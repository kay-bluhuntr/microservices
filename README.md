This is fork of the **Online Boutique** unofficial customised microservices project by google which is a cloud-first microservices demo application.
**Online Boutique** consists of an 11-tier microservices application. The application is a
web-based e-commerce app where users can browse items,
add them to the cart, and purchase them.

This application is used to demonstrate use of technologies like:

* Kubernetes/EKS
* Helm
* Github Action
* Ansible
* Shell
* AWS

## Quickstart (MiniKube)

1. Install Minikube **[Instruction Here] (https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/)** or Skip if you already have minikube installed or any other kubernetes cluster ready

2. **Clone this repository.**

```
git clone https://github.com/kay-bluhuntr/microservices.git
cd microservices
```

3. **Install Helm/Helm Chart** 
**[Helm can be installed from here](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)**
Sample: Using MACOS here and brew
```
brew install helm
```

4. **Deploy the App to your cluster.**

```
cd kubernetes-services
ch

kubectl port-forward deployment/frontend 8080:8080 -n microservices-development

```

5. **Wait for the Pods to be ready.**

```
kubectl get pods
```

After a few minutes, you should see:

```

shippingservice-6ccc89f8fd-v686r         1/1     Running   0          2m58s
```

7. **Access the web frontend in a browser** using the frontend's `EXTERNAL_IP`.

```
kubectl get service frontend-external | awk '{print $4}'
```

*Example output - do not copy*

```
EXTERNAL-IP
<your-ip>
```

**Note**- you may see `<pending>` while GCP provisions the load balancer. If this happens, wait a few minutes and re-run the command.

8. [Optional] **Clean up**:

```
gcloud container clusters delete onlineboutique \
    --project=${PROJECT_ID} --zone=${ZONE}
```

## Use Terraform to provision a GKE cluster and deploy Online Boutique

The [`/terraform` folder](terraform) contains instructions for using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/intro) to replicate the steps from [**Quickstart (GKE)**](#quickstart-gke) above.

## Other deployment variations

- **Istio**: [See these instructions.](docs/service-mesh.md)
- **Anthos Service Mesh**: [See these instructions](/docs/service-mesh.md)
- **non-GKE clusters (Minikube, Kind)**: see the [Development Guide](/docs/development-guide.md)

## Deploy Online Boutique variations with Kustomize

The [`/kustomize` folder](kustomize) contains instructions for customizing the deployment of Online Boutique with different variations such as:
* integrating with [Google Cloud Operations](kustomize/components/google-cloud-operations/)
* replacing the in-cluster Redis cache with [Google Cloud Memorystore (Redis)](kustomize/components/memorystore) or [Google Cloud Spanner](kustomize/components/spanner)
* etc.

## Architecture

**Online Boutique** is composed of 11 microservices written in different
languages that talk to each other over gRPC.

microservices](./docs/img/architecture-diagram.png)](./docs/img/architecture-diagram.png)

## Features

- **[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io)/[GKE](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/):**
  The app is designed to run on Kubernetes (both locally on "Docker for
  Desktop", as well as on the cloud with GKE).
- **[gRPC](https://grpc.io):** Microservices use a high volume of gRPC calls to
  communicate to each other.
- **[Istio](https://istio.io):** Application works on Istio service mesh.
- **[Cloud Operations (Stackdriver)](https://cloud.google.com/products/operations):** Many services
  are instrumented with **Profiling** and **Tracing**. In
  addition to these, using Istio enables features like Request/Response
  **Metrics** and **Context Graph** out of the box. When it is running out of
  Google Cloud, this code path remains inactive.
- **[Skaffold](https://skaffold.dev):** Application
  is deployed to Kubernetes with a single command using Skaffold.
- **Synthetic Load Generation:** The application demo comes with a background
  job that creates realistic usage patterns on the website using
  [Locust](https://locust.io/) load generator.

## Local Development

If you would like to contribute features or fixes to this app, see the [Development Guide](/docs/development-guide.md) on how to build this demo locally.
