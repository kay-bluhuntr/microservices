This is a fork of the **Online Boutique** unofficial microservices project by google which I have customised by adding some new products and changed to use  Github Action as the CI. 
A cloud-first microservices demo application.
**Online Boutique** consists of an 11-tier microservices application. The application is a web-based e-commerce app where users can browse items,
add them to the cart, and purchase them.

This application is used to demonstrate use of technologies like:

* Kubernetes/EKS
* Helm
* Github Action
* Ansible
* Shell
* AWS

## Quickstart (MiniKube)

1. Install Minikube 
**[Instruction Here] (https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/)** or Skip if you already have minikube installed or any other kubernetes cluster ready

2. **Clone this repository.**

```
git clone https://github.com/kay-bluhuntr/microservices.git
cd microservices
```

3. Install Helm/Helm Chart
**[Helm can be installed from here](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)**
Sample: Using MACOS here and brew
```
brew install helm
```

4. **Deploy the App to your cluster.**

```
cd kubernetes-services
chmod 700 deploy-services.sh destroy-service.sh
./deploy-service.sh
```

5. **Wait for the Pods to be ready.**

```
kubectl get pods -n microservices-development
```

After a few minutes, you should see:

```

## Architecture

**Online Boutique** is composed of 11 microservices written in different
languages that talk to each other over gRPC.

## Features

- **[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io):**
  The app is designed to run on Kubernetes (both locally on "Docker for
  Desktop" and Minikube, as well as on the cloud with GKE, AKS or EKS).
- **[gRPC](https://grpc.io):** Microservices use a high volume of gRPC calls to
  communicate to each other.

## Local Development

If you would like to contribute features or fixes to this app, see the [Development Guide](/docs/development-guide.md) on how to build this demo locally.
